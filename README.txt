INCOMPLETE!!!!
*******************************************

This project is being used not only to learn (relearn) parts of the C programming language but to learn all the different features of git and version control. It is to be exclusively written in the C programming language and compiled using the GNU C Compiler in MinGW.

WARNING. The code and documentation probably sucks :)

This project has now also turned into a way for learning how to use 
the windows API. This may slow progress considerably....

THIS GAME IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

********************************************
********************************************
Current state of the game
********************************************
********************************************
The player should be able to simply run the game in a command line. There is no GUI at the moment but one will be added at a later point in time.

Most of the implemented functions and menus work correctly but there are still input errors mostly to do with the input buffer overflowing. There are no graphics (even ASCII) as of yet but that should be implemented soon.

**********************************************
GAME FLOW
**********************************************

The game starts and then the player is shown the main menu. The player
chooses an option from the menu by entering a number.

The word is chosen randomly from a list. The list is chosen depending 
on the difficulty chosen by the player.
