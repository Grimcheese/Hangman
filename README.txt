This project is being used not only to learn (relearn) parts of the C
programming language but to learn all the different features of git 
and version control. 

WARNING. The code probably sucks :)

THIS GAME IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

*************************************************

The player should be able to simply run the game in a command line. 
There is no GUI at the moment but one will be added at a later point
in time.

**********************************************

The game starts and then the player is shown the main menu. The player
chooses an option from the menu by entering a number.

The word is chosen randomly from a list. The list is chosen depending 
on the difficulty chosen by the player.
